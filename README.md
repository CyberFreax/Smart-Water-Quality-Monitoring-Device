# Smart-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System ðŸ’§

This is my Arduino-powered **Smart Water Quality Monitoring System** â€” a compact device designed to monitor the quality of water at **railway stations**. It measures pH, TDS, turbidity, and temperature using appropriate sensors and displays the values in real-time on a 0.96" OLED screen.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Monitors:
  - pH (acidity/alkalinity)
  - TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
  - Turbidity (water clarity)
  - Temperature
- Displays real-time readings on an OLED screen
- Ideal for deployment at railway stations and public water points
- Compact, low-power, and easy to assemble
